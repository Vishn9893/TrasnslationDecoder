I'm showing the steps here for pushing the data to the db

1. First make sure that MySQL is running in the background
2. Then run the exe (make sure to include the points file and xml near the exe)
3. enter your desired database name, table and authentication details
4. here, my root user does not have a password(just press enter)
5. now the database, table are created and the data is inserted
